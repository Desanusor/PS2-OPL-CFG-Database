Description=Taking inspiration from the presentation style and structure of a number of acclaimed and globally popular TV action dramas-Alone in the Dark is split into a number of distinct episodes in a season-style format. With approximately 30-40 minutes of gameplay comprising each episode-the structure of Alone in the Dark is adapted for an audience familiar with the hard-hitting bite-size delivery of contemporary TV dramas-offering easy accessibility whether the player has hours to devote or only wants a quick TV-style fix. Each time the player launches a saved game-the episode begins with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story-removing the need to remember where they were or what they were doing. Every episode closes with a nail-biting cliff-hanger ending to rattle players'' nerves-and if the player is leaving the game a video teaser of the next episode plays to leave them wanting more. Alone in the Dark returns with a heart-stopping survival experience realized through the use of state-of-the-art real-time physics and unprecedented environmental interaction. Delivering an action-orientated experience within a highly detailed-open environment-Alone in the Dark once again strives innovation and excellence within the genre. '
